Intellij Project:

SERVLET AND DATABASE - used for connecting the front end UI with the cloud deployed database

***As of now, the server used for bank transactions is down, so that feature has been commented out***

The two main packages are the servlets used to run the heroku based SQL commands and the classes which contain the instructions to be executed by the servlets
